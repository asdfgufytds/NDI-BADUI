            Welcome to BADUI, where your privacy is optional. By using our services,<br>
            you agree to the following completely reasonable and uninvasive terms:
            <br>
            1. Data We Collect<br>
            We collect everything. This includes, but is not limited to:<br>
            <br>
            Your name, address, phone number, social security number just to name<br>
            a few...<br>
            The contents of your email, private messages, and diary entries (yes,<br>
            we’re reading that too).<br>
            Every photo you've ever taken, we have especially developed scrapers<br>
            for that purpose.<br>
            Your exact location, down to the millimeter, at all times—even in the<br>
            bathroom.<br>
            <br>
            2. How We Use Your Data<br>
            Your data will be used in the following ways:<br>
            <br>
            Sold to shady marketing companies and scam call centers.<br>
            Used to train AI that will one day replace you at your job.<br>
            Exchanged for bitcoin on piratebay.<br>
            <br>
            3. Cookies<br>
            Our cookies do more than track your browsing activity. They:<br>
            <br>
            Monitor how long you stare at each image.<br>
            Send daily reports to authorities about your online activity (not that<br>
            they already track that lol).<br>
            You cannot disable cookies. If you try, we’ll still track you, but you<br>
            won't have proof.<br>
            <br>
            4. Sharing Your Data<br>
            We generously share your data with:<br>
            <br>
            Governments (even the ones you’ve never heard of).<br>
            Telemarketers and scammers, as well as hackers.<br>
            Companies that specialize in selling back your own data to you.<br>
            <br>
            5. Your Rights<br>
            You have the right to:<br>
            <br>
            Remain silent, as anything you do online can and will be used against<br>
            you.<br>
            Send us an email asking to delete your data (we’ll reply with a GIF<br>
            of someone laughing hysterically).<br>
            Sue us (just kidding, our lawyers are the best. No point in trying)<br>
            <br>
            6. How We Store Your Data<br>
            We store your data in:<br>
            <br>
            A highly secure database protected by a strong encryption system.<br>
            Random USB drives we leave lying around in coffee shops.<br>
            4Chan, GitHub, basically free storage.<br>
            <br>
            7. Third-Party Services<br>
            We work with third parties who are even less trustworthy than we are:<br>
            <br>
            SpyScope: Watches you through your webcam, even when it's off.<br>
            PhishPal: Emails you links that look legit but definitely aren’t.<br>
            Pegasus: we don't talk about this one...<br>
            <br>
            8. Changes to This Policy<br>
            We can change this policy at any time without notice.<br>
            <br>
            9. Data Breaches<br>
            In the event of a data breach:<br>
            <br>
            We’ll pretend it never happened.<br>
            Blame you for using our service, it wasn't our choice after all!<br>
            <br>
            10. Contact Us<br>
            If you have questions about this policy, please:<br>
            <br>
            Speak about it with a wall, that would get you further then trying<br>
            to contact us (assuming you even find contact information).<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Thanks for chosing our services!<br>
            <br>
